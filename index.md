**<font size = "5">Welcome to the RAISE Lab @ Penn State!</font>**

The RAISE Lab is a group of Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers within the <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/">College of Information Sciences and Technology</a> at the <a href="https://www.psu.edu/">Pennsylvania State University</a> that make foundational contributions to the field of <i>Responsible AI for Social Emancipation</i>; our goal is to advance the state-of-the-art in AI tools and algorithms to solve critical challenges faced by marginalized communities around the world, while ensuring that our algorithms do not exacerbate existing health/social/economic inequities in society.
