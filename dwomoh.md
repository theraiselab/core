# Dr. Francis Dwomoh
## Postdoctoral Research Associate

### Education
- PhD, Geospatial science & Engineering, South Dakota State University (USA), 2018
- MSc, Geo-information Science and Earth Observation, University of Twente (Faculty ITC, the Netherlands) & Kwame Nkrumah University of Science & Technology (KNUST, Ghana), 2009
- BSc, Natural Resources Management, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science & Technology (KNUST, Ghana), 2002

### Research Interests
Landscape Ecology, Disturbance Ecology, Remote Sensing, Land Cover/Use Change, Geographic Information Science

Dr. Francis Dwomoh utilizes a variety of remotely-sensed Earth observations and field data to study the interactions of climate, land use/cover, and fire regimes, and how disturbances affect the resilience and vulnerability of terrestrial ecosystems. His research aims to provide insights into the pathways and drivers of disturbance land cover change that are necessary for improving our understanding of tropical forest ecosystem changes. Dr. Dwomoh received a highly competitive NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship (NNX14AL23H) in support of his PhD research. He holds a PhD in Geospatial Science & Engineering from South Dakota State University (USA), an MSc in Geo-information Science and Earth Observation jointly from the University of Twente (Faculty ITC, the Netherlands) & Kwame Nkrumah University of Science & Technology (KNUST, Ghana). He earned a BSc in Natural Resources Management from KNUST (Ghana).
