### Education
* Ph.D. in Geography (Medical Geography) and Certificate in One Health, University of Florida
* Graduate Diploma in Geographic Information Systems, Flinders University, Australia
* M.S. in Public Health and Certificate in Disaster Management & Humanitarian Assistance, University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa
* B.S. in Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology


### Research & Interests
Dawn Nekorchuk is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability at the University of Oklahoma and a member of the EcoGRAPH research group. She is the current lead R developer for the EPIDEMIA project for forecasting climate-mediated infectious diseases, especially the current implementation for malaria forecasting in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. 
In this project, she has:

*	Developed an R package, [epidemiar](https://github.com/EcoGRAPH/epidemiar), for integrating epidemiology and environmental data to produce disease forecasts with early detection and early warning alerts
*	Developed data workflows and wrote customized R code to support local Ethiopian partners in generating their own malaria forecast reports
*	Designed new weekly report statistics and format with collaboration with Ethiopian public health officials for their use for intervention planning and response
*	Co-lead/assisted with R and forecasting system training workshops: 2017 USA, 2018 Ethiopia
*	Created [tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-NKR1cer4wkg8hHHP7K9Vw) and documentation for Ethiopian colleagues
*	Created an outbreak event detection algorithm to allow for declining long term trends in the context of malaria elimination interventions.

In her previous doctoral research, she modeled and analyzed of bison movement patterns and space use as compared to potential risk areas from ecological niche model _Bacillus anthracis_ presence estimates, and wrote a compartmental model for anthrax transmission in R combining data from 2008 outbreak plus published literature.  
Her public health master's research was on bioterrorism preparedness of licensed professionals (physicians, nurses, dentists, veterinarians, social workers and psychologists) in Hawaii. 

Dr. Nekorchuk is also involved in the [Software and Data Carpentry workshops at OU](https://libraries.ou.edu/content/software-and-data-carpentry) and training to become an instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).
